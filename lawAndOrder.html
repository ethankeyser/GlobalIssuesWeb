        <p>
The Scottsboro Boys were a group of nine black boys in Alabama who were arrested when a fight broke out on a freight train in 1931. These boys were arrested on minor charges and their ages ranged from 13 to 19 years old. However, the police then questioned two white women named Ruby Bates and Victoria Price, who then accused the boys of raping them on the train. The boys were then transferred to Scottsboro for a trial in the local court. When the boys arrived there, they were greeted by an angry mob of white people. When the trial began, the jury consisted of all white men who sentenced eight of the boys to death and the 13-year-old boy had a mistrial. This case when then appealed to higher courts with the help of the International Labor Defense. The International Labor Defense was able to build some publicity behind this case and many supported the boys, holding rallies and protests. However, when the Alabama supreme court finally heard the case of the eight boys, seven of the convictions were upheld and one boy was granted a new trial because he was a minor at the time. The United States supreme court then heard the case, famously known as Powell v. Alabama. The United States supreme court came to the conclusion that the boys were denied the right to counsel which violated the 14th amendment. The trials were then handed back to the local courts so that the boys were given a new trial. When the trials went back to local courts in Alabama, one of the initial accusers, Ruby Bates, announced that she had lied about the charges and agreed to testify. Even with her testimonial, one of the boys was, again, sentenced to death by an all-white male jury. However, the judge overruled that decision and allowed him a new trial. When two of the boys were retried, they were sentenced to death again and the Alabama supreme court refused to allow them new trials. The second United States supreme court case, called Norris v. Alabama, led to the conclusion that the defendants were not given a fair trial due to the lack of diversity on the jury. However, only 5 of the defendant’s rape charges were dropped and one ended up in prison for assaulting a police officer. The rest were eventually let out on parole. The two landmark supreme court cases and the uproar that this caused, led to the civil rights movement and other important landmarks for black people. However, these cases represent the dark history of racism and injustice in America, which is still happening today. These cases highlight the extremities of racism in the 1900s and outline some of the unfair trials that are happening today. These cases have allowed for more diverse juries and a realization for many that trials are often unfair. Learning about this trial is important so that the United States, as a whole, can avoid unfair trials and racism in the future.
