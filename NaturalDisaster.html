        <p>The SS Edmund Fitzgerald was a steamship commissioned by the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company in 1957. This ship was the largest ship on the great lakes at the time and measured an astounding 729 feet and weighed over 13600 tons. This boat frequently shipped iron ore and other types of metals across lake Superior. The ship’s last voyage began on November 9, 1975, and departed from Superior Wisconsin headed towards Detroit. Later in the day gale warnings were issued for the lake and the Edmund Fitzgerald and the Arthur M. Anderson decided to change course and went on a northern passage. The winds then began to shift and the only option for the Edmund Fitzgerald was to head straight into the deadly storm. When the massive ship entered the storm, winds rose all the way up to 70 knots and the waves grew all the way to 25 feet. Later in the night, the Arthur M. Anderson mentioned that the Edmund Fitzgerald passed severely close to a shoal and when the Edmund Fitzgerald radioed them later that night, they noted that they had minor damage. Around 45 minutes later the Edmund Fitzgerald requested assistance due to their radars failing. An hour later they reported that their damage was severe and the last words heard from the ship were “we’re holding our own.” All 29 crew members of the ship did not make it and an $8.4 million dollar ship was lost with all of its cargo. The Edmund Fitzgerald did everything in its ability to avoid this outcome but many theories arise as to what caused the ship to sink. The Coast Guard reported that the reason the ship sank was due to improperly closed hatches and too much water getting on board during the storm. Others suggest that the boat was not designed correctly and that it carried far past its weight limit. Nonetheless, the storm predictions could have been taken into account more seriously and an accurate escape route should have been known. Although we do not know exactly what happened to the ship, there could have been much better precautions taken to avoid this outcome. One option would have been to redirect to a different port along the lake, even if the fuel expenditure would have been much more. However, all of these things are much easier said than actually performed. Boats have come a long way since 1975 and safety features and larger ships have allowed boats to voyage across extremely rough seas in bad weather. It is quite easy to avoid this type of disaster currently, due to the technology and the predictability of storms. However, there are still major issues with ships at sea and on the great lakes. This is due to the unreliability of the sea and wave heights because things can change in an instant. The tragedy of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald will remain a mystery but is a disaster that has helped shape future technology and safety precautions for the shipping industry.
