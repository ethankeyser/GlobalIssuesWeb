        <p>
          	China has risen into an economic superpower over the last few decades and with that followed a new society and government. Instead of turning into a more Western society like many thought, China turned into a regulated and harshly supervised nation. Chinese people are told to work hard and follow all the rules and they might be able to succeed in life and escape or prevent themselves from living in poverty. They are told to stay out of politics and focus on their own work and they will be rewarded. The government promises a good life for all people if they work hard and agree to stay out of political matters. People are brought together by a sense of nationalism and are told that the government is doing what is best to create a great nation. Nobody speaks out due to fear and threats that the government offers to those who oppose their authority. China controls media very strictly and will find out about anyone who is creating information that criticizes the government. China is able to monitor online information by creating firewalls, closely monitoring social media and posts, and jailing journalists that expose anything they do. Although the Chinese constitution states that its people are entitled to free speech and press, the government is able to crack down on information they deem as “revealing state secrets” or information that “endangers the state.” Both definitions of these terms are extremely vague which allows the government to crack down on any information they do not like. In 2010, the Chinese government created a new set of rules for internet users in China. A strict set of regulations and rules were put in place that all internet providers had to abide by, along with anyone who provides information or services to China. When Xi Jinping became president in 2016, he tightened internet rules even more. He essentially said that any information or service that states anything against any ideals of the political party is forbidden. China monitors the services that are available on the internet very closely. They block certain websites that they deem as “dangerous.” Some of these websites include Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, and other Google services. They have even blocked these services temporarily on days of controversy such as the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre. China has been known to harass American reporters and deny visas if they find something that they have written that is against their government. When the NBA voiced statements about Hong Kong’s human rights violations, China was quick to censor all of this and ban certain games from being viewed in China. China’s strict control over media and people’s opinions has allowed them to rule a country that does not value human rights or freedom. They have blocked the truth from being spread in the country and have used propaganda to sway citizens into thinking that they are doing nothing wrong. Nationalism also seems to be a strong tool in uniting the people of China and motivating people to work hard. Overall, China has countless ways of controlling its people and something needs to change if Chinese people would like to see freedom one day.
