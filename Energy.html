        <p>
          Hydrogen energy has long been seen as dangerous and the cause of disasters like the Hindenberg and the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger launch. However, hydrogen is actually a very safe energy carrier that can be used to help the world rid of dirtier fuels like oil. Claims have been made that hydrogen is too difficult to extract and it is mostly extracted using fossil fuels. This is partly true but there is a way to extract hydrogen and use it with zero traces of carbon emissions. The main ways to extract hydrogen are through thermochemical processes, electrolysis, and direct solar water splitting. The thermochemical process uses resources like natural gas, coal, and biomass to release hydrogen from their molecular structure. Electrolysis uses electricity to split the hydrogen and oxygen atoms from water. This is a highly developed process and can be used in combination with things like solar panels and windmills. Perhaps the cleanest of all the ways is the direct solar water-splitting process. This process uses light energy to separate the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in water and it is in its early stages of testing. Hydrogen is less dangerous than many other common fuels because of its high flammability temperature and because it must be a much higher concentration to be flammable in the air. Hydrogen must reach a temperature of 550 degrees celsius before it can burn in the absence of a spark, compared to the 260 degrees Celsius temperature that gasoline needs to reach. In terms of concentration in the air, hydrogen must reach a concentration of 4% before being flammable while gasoline is just 1.4%. So what can we use hydrogen for? One of the most popular uses of hydrogen is for rocket fuel, but we can also use hydrogen to power cars. The way this is able to happen is through a fuel cell that converts hydrogen into electricity. This is done by separating the single electron from the single proton in a hydrogen atom and using the electron to produce a stream of electricity. Hydrogen-powered cars have also been proven to be much more efficient than those powered by gasoline. Currently, people are still concerned about hydrogen and its dangers. Hydrogen poses a few dangers that are easily dealt with. One issue is that hydrogen ignites extremely easily in the presence of an oxidizer and it can even ignite from the spark from someone’s finger. Another issue is that if someone were to breathe in pure hydrogen in an enclosed space, they would not know it and they would eventually suffocate. The first issue is not a big deal because, in reality, it is as likely to catch fire as gasoline and it rises extremely quickly so the flames will be away from the site of an accident. The second issue is not a big deal unless someone is in an enclosed space with the hydrogen, however, this concern should be taken into account. Another big misconception that people have is that hydrogen cars will explode when they crash on the road. The chances of a hydrogen vehicle exploding on impact are very small because even if the fuel cell were punctured, the hydrogen would most likely dissipate and rise into the air instead of combusting. There have also been multiple crash tests done with hydrogen-powered cars that did not result in an explosion whatsoever. Hydrogen-powered cars are not very popular currently because there are not many places to fuel a hydrogen-powered vehicle. Companies that create these vehicles have given people the incentive to purchase hydrogen-powered vehicles by giving them credit to purchase and refuel their vehicles with hydrogen. However, this does not combat the availability of hydrogen refueling stations. With that being said, hydrogen-powered vehicles could be the future of clean energy. However, this will most likely not happen due to the push for electric cars. Hydrogen is still an extremely powerful and clean energy carrier that can be used for many other electrical processes if done correctly.
