          Marijuana has been a difficult topic when describing the negative effects of it and whether or not it should be legalized. The younger generation has promoted the legalization of it, mostly by saying that it does not have many negative mental effects or physical effects. Marijuana is used in many different ways with the most popular ways being smoking and consuming it. The main chemical in Marijuana is THC which enters the bloodstream after the marijuana is used and the blood carries the chemical to the brain where a “high” is felt. One of the major issues in today’s society is that teenagers and young adults are using marijuana when their brain is still not fully developed. Studies have shown that teens that use marijuana have shown negative effects towards thinking, memory, learning functions, and overall brain development. However, there is still research being done to prove whether or not these effects are permanent. A study conducted in New Zealand with help from researchers at Duke University, showed that people who began smoking marijuana frequently in their teenage years lost an average IQ of 8 between ages 13 and 38. The study did show, however, that there was no significant IQ decrease in those who started smoking marijuana as adults. Another study was done on multiple pairs of twins that showed that there was a significant decrease in general knowledge and verbal ability in those who used marijuana. However, the study did not show any significant difference between the twins when one used marijuana and the other did not. Some researchers suggest that family factors and other outside factors caused some subjects to have a decrease in IQ. Smoking marijuana also has some physical effects if it is smoked often. Due to smoke being inhaled into the lungs, smoking marijuana can cause some lung issues and breathing problems, none of which have been linked to lung cancer. Frequently smoking marijuana can also cause a syndrome called Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome that causes regular cycles of nausea, vomiting, and dehydration. Other studies have shown links to mental illness and conditions such as hallucinations, paranoia, and worsening effects of schizophrenia for those who experience it. More studies have shown links to depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts in teens, but other studies have opposed this. A major question concerning marijuana today is if it is addictive. To find the answer to this question, the two types of addiction have to be considered: physical and psychological. Physical addictions are when the body depends on the substance to function normally. Psychological addiction deals with dependency on the drug when the user cannot escape the feeling it creates for them. Experts have stated that marijuana is not physically addictive, but rather a psychological addiction. Reports have shown that 17-20% of users become dependent on marijuana, especially those who are using it at a young age. There are withdrawal symptoms for some users that include insomnia, anxiety, depression, and irritability. So what can we take from this? Should marijuana be legalized? Marijuana is not considered a dangerous drug at all and has not shown negative health effects that come with other drugs. Legalization would solve many problems unrelated to the effects of marijuana but these effects are still things we should consider when preventing certain people from accessing the drug. Young people are at the most risk of psychological harm from marijuana, so preventing teenagers and young adults from using the drug is important.
